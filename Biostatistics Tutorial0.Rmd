So let's do an internet course; Academic Lesson's "Biostatistics Tutorial Full course for Beginners to Experts". But we'll use the data I've collected so far and if I need any more I'll download any missing dataset types described. 

The first module is the introduction and only really gives definitions:

All of Which is all quite nice and defined as:

**Statistical**

  - Statistic: A characteristic that describes a sample
  
  - Parameter: A characteristic that describes a population
 
  - Descriptive Statistics, describing and communicating information simply
  
  - Inferential Statistics, drawing conclusions from data and inferring
  
  - Population: A set of all individuals of interest

  - Sample: A selection of individuals from a population
  
  - Variable: Characteristics that change across conditions 
  
  - Data: A collection of observations 
  
  - Datum: One observation of information
  
  - Sampling Error: The discrepancy between the true population parameter and the sample statistic


**Research**

  - Correlation Method, examines two variables as they exist naturally are observed to determine if relationships exist between them.
  
  - Experimental Method, demonstrates a cause and effect relationship between two variables
  
  - Quasi-Experimental Method: Non experimental study that examines pre-existing groups
  
  - Independent Variable: What is manipulated
  
  - Dependent Variable: What is measured
  
  - Quasi-Independent Variable: Observations that are inseparable from an individual and cannot reasonably be manipulated


**Measurement**

  - Discrete Variable: Can only take on whole numbers, no fractions of decimals
  
  - Continuous Variable: Has an infinite number of values between two values
  
  - Real Limits: Borders set on continuous variables
  
  - Upper Real Limit: the Real limit with the higher value
  
  - Ordinal Scale: Values are ordered by some measurement of magnitude
  
  - Lower Real Limit: the Real limit with the lower value
  
  - Interval Scale: Constitutes of ordered categories that are intervals of the same size
  
  - Nominal Scale: Values are categorized only by their names
  
  - Ration Scale: an interval scale with an absolute zero point that is meaningful


All that said, all of this was r-notebooks' HTML. It's pretty easy enough to simply the copy and paste into the 'HTML' section on the WYSIWYG editor.
